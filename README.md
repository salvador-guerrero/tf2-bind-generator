# [TF2 Bind Generator](https://tf2bindgenerator.appspot.com/)
This is a simple web application that converts a multiple line text into a TF2 script to 'say' that text line by line in the game's chat

Mostly made in AngularJS and Bootstrap, with Django as a way of interfacing with Google's app engine

Most interesting stuff is located here:
